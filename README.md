# Lane Detection with OpenCV

This project uses OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library, to detect lane markings on roads in images or video streams.

## Process Overview

1. *Pre-processing:*
    - *Image Acquisition:* Load the image or establish a video feed for real-time processing.
    - *Grayscale Conversion:* Convert the image from RGB (color) to grayscale for simpler processing.
    - *Noise Reduction:* Apply techniques like Gaussian blur to reduce noise and enhance edge detection.

2. *Region of Interest (ROI) Selection:*
    - Identify the area in the image most likely to contain lane markings (typically the lower half of the image). This reduces processing time and focuses on relevant regions.

3. *Edge Detection:*
    - Apply algorithms like Canny Edge Detection to identify sharp intensity changes in the image, potentially indicating lane edges.

4. *Hough Line Transform:*
    - Utilize the Hough Transform to identify lines within the detected edges. This helps distinguish lane markings from other linear features in the image.

5. *Filtering and Refinement:*
    - Filter the detected lines based on parameters like length and angle to remove spurious lines and focus on those resembling lane markings.

6. *Visualization (Optional):*
    - Overlay the detected lane lines onto the original image or video stream to visualize the results.

## Benefits

- *Driver Assistance Systems:* This technology can be a foundation for developing lane departure warning systems or lane centering functions in autonomous vehicles.
- *Traffic Monitoring:* By analyzing lane usage, this technology can potentially contribute to traffic flow monitoring and management systems.

This project provides a valuable introduction to image processing and line detection techniques using OpenCV. It serves as a stepping stone for exploring more advanced applications in computer vision and autonomous vehicle development.
